# FlappyQuiz

FlappyQuiz is a unique blend of the classic "Flappy Bird" gameplay and an AI-powered study tool. Players navigate a bird through pipes, and upon crashing, must answer quiz questions generated from their own study notes to continue or track progress.

## Features

-   **Classic Gameplay**: Authentic physics and pixel-art visuals inspired by the original Flappy Bird.
-   **AI-Powered Quizzes**: Upload your notes, and the game uses Gemini AI to generate custom quiz questions (MCQ & True/False).
-   **Survival Mode**: When you crash, you are presented with a quiz question. Answer correctly to boost your stats and learning.
-   **Neo-Brutalist UI**: A bold, modern interface design with "Neal.fun" vibes.
-   **No Sign-in Required**: Works entirely in the browser.

## How to Play

1.  **Fly**: Tap the screen or click to flap your wings and avoid pipes.
2.  **Crash**: When you hit a pipe, the game pauses.
3.  **Quiz**: Answer the question presented.
    *   **Correct**: You earn XP and stats.
    *   **Wrong**: You must try again or move to the next question.
4.  **Notes**: Go to the "Notes" tab to paste your study materials and generate new questions.
